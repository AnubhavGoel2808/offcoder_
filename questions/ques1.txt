<p><span class="tex-font-style-it">A bow adorned with nameless flowers that bears the earnest hopes of an equally nameless person.</span></p>
<p>You have obtained the elegant bow known as the Windblume Ode. Inscribed in the weapon is an array of $$$n$$$ ($$$n \ge 3$$$) positive <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> integers (i.e. different, no duplicates are allowed).</p>
<p>Find the largest subset (i.e. having the maximum number of elements) of this array such that its sum is a composite number. A positive integer $$$x$$$ is called composite if there exists a positive integer $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 &lt; y &lt; x$$$ and $$$x$$$ is divisible by $$$y$$$.</p>
<p>If there are multiple subsets with this largest size with the composite sum, you can output any of them. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem such a non-empty subset always exists.</p>
<div class="section-title">
 Input
</div>
<p>Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 100$$$)&nbsp;— the length of the array.</p>
<p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> integers $$$a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_{i} \leq 200$$$)&nbsp;— the elements of the array.</p>
<div class="section-title">
 Output
</div>
<p>Each test case should have two lines of output.</p>
<p>The first line should contain a single integer $$$x$$$: the size of the largest subset with composite sum. The next line should contain $$$x$$$ space separated integers representing the indices of the subset of the initial array.</p>

 Note

<p>In the first test case, the subset $$$\{a_2, a_1\}$$$ has a sum of $$$9$$$, which is a composite number. The only subset of size $$$3$$$ has a prime sum equal to $$$11$$$. Note that you could also have selected the subset $$$\{a_1, a_3\}$$$ with sum $$$8 + 2 = 10$$$, which is composite as it's divisible by $$$2$$$.</p>
<p>In the second test case, the sum of all elements equals to $$$21$$$, which is a composite number. Here we simply take the whole array as our subset.</p>
