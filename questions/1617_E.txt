<p>Christmas is coming, Icy has just received a box of chocolates from her grandparents! The box contains $$$n$$$ chocolates. The $$$i$$$-th chocolate has a non-negative integer type $$$a_i$$$.</p>
<p>Icy believes that good things come in pairs. Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all $$$a_i$$$ are <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span>). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. </p>
<p>As a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some <span class="tex-font-style-it">chocolate exchanges</span>. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Before performing any chocolate exchanges</span>, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le n$$$, $$$x \ne y$$$).</p>
<p>In a <span class="tex-font-style-it">chocolate exchange</span>, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer $$$k$$$, such that $$$2^k \ge a_x$$$, and change the type of the chocolate $$$x$$$ from $$$a_x$$$ to $$$2^k - a_x$$$ (that is, perform $$$a_x := 2^k - a_x$$$).</p>
<p>The chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when $$$a_x = a_y$$$. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure.</span></p>
<p>Icy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that <span class="tex-font-style-bf">minimizes</span> the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to <span class="tex-font-style-bf">maximize</span> the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair $$$(x, y)$$$ such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of $$$(x, y)$$$.</p>
<p>Since Icy is not good at math, she hopes that you can help her solve the problem.</p>
<div class="section-title">
 Input
</div>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)&nbsp;â€” the number of chocolates.</p>
<p>The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.</p>
<div class="section-title">
 Output
</div>
<p>Output three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$m$$$.</p>
<p>$$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on. Your output must satisfy $$$1 \le x, y \le n$$$, $$$x \ne y$$$.</p>
<p>$$$m$$$ is the number of exchanges needed to obtain $$$a_x = a_y$$$. We can show that $$$m \le 10^9$$$ for any pair of chocolates.</p>
<p>If there are multiple solutions, output any.</p>

 Note

<p>In the first test case, the minimum number of exchanges needed to exchange a chocolate of type $$$6$$$ to a chocolate of type $$$9$$$ is $$$5$$$. The sequence of exchanges is as follows: $$$6 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 9$$$.</p>
<p>In the second test case, the minimum number of exchanges needed to exchange a chocolate of type $$$4$$$ to a chocolate of type $$$8$$$ is $$$2$$$. The sequence of exchanges is as follows: $$$4 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 8$$$.</p>
